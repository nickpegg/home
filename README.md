This is a Django app that runs my home! And some aspects of my life, too.

It's pretty sparse so far.

## What's Implemented

* Brewhouse - What I'm brewing, what's on tap, planning, etc.
* Weight Tracking - Pretty much for my own purposes. Snatches data from Withings.

## TODO

* Temperature control/graphing
* Reminders/TODO list
* Light control
    * Need to dust off some X10 code, install switches

## Way-Future TODO

* Build a fancy computer-controlled brewing system, have this interface to that.
