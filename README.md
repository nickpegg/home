# home.nickpegg.com

This is a Django app that runs my home! And some aspects of my life, too. 

It's pretty sparse so far.

## What's Implemented

* Brewhouse - What I'm brewing, what's on tap, planning, etc. 

## TODO

* Reminders
* Light control 
    * Need to dust off some X10 code, install switches
* Temperature control/graphing 
    * Need to buy a WiFi-enabled thermostat first

## Way-Future TODO

* Build a fancy computer-controlled brewing system, have this interface to that.
